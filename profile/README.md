## Welcome!

We are an electronics company currently prototyping our first product for release in the consumer motorsports simulation market.
It will be a peripheral device for existing rigs, not a vital component such as a wheelbase or pedals.
<br>
<br>
## Roadmap
There is no set timeline, but we plan to release a simple V1 sometime in 2023. This version will not have the full suite of features we are planning
for the future, however, most, if not all, will be available later on as a firmware/software update.
<br>
<br>
A detailed roadmap along with more information will be available in the coming months and be accessible from our [website](https://merrildynamics.com).
<br>

## Developers
Sometime after the V1 release we plan to open source the firmware and design so that custom firmwares may be made, and the device can be built
at home.

### Tech
It is based on a STM32F4 MCU and the LEDs are WS2812b neopixels. The firmware is written in Rust, and the desktop app will be running on Tauri
using Rust and HTML/JS.
